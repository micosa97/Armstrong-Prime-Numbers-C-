Other solution of the problem.
I advise you to see Ruby solution first. It's just another implementation of similar Algo. I decided to use another Probalistic Prime Test (not so ambitious and creative, but effective one).  
It works faster than Ruby Code, but it was required to make some strange structure (class longerint with its own algebra) so it may look a little bit complicated.
